2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add a page with the shortcode: [frontier-post] in the content (will be added during activation)
4. Add the page to your menu
5: Update Frontier Post settings 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Known Issues and limitations =
* Custom Fields: Only with Templates, Filters and actions
* If limited administrator access is selected for a profile in Theme My Login, media uploads will fail for this profile.
* If you hide page title for certain pages, the title will also be hidden in the breadcrumbs

= Template Forms =
* You can copy the forms located in the forms directory of the plugin to your theme
 * create a subdirectory in you theme (or child theme) folder: /plugins/frontier-post/ - Example: wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/plugins/frontier-post/
* The custom templates is quite easy (example below is if you installed wp in the root):
 * Navigate to ./wp-content/plugins/frontier-post/forms
 * Copy form php files
 * Navigate to ./wp.content/themes/[your active theme]/
 * check if ./wp.content/themes/[your active theme]/plugins/frontier-post/ exists, if not create it
 * Paste the files to ./wp.content/themes/[your active theme]/plugins/frontier-post/
 * edit the files

Be aware that the template files will be deleted on theme upgrade, so make sure you have a copy, or use a child theme 


= Editor =
* From version 3.9 an onwards, you need to use separate pluging: [Frontier Buttons](http://wordpress.org/plugins/frontier-buttons/)

= Widgets =
* Widgets are not cached as content is based on current logged in user. 
* Widget queries are index optimized, but queries will execute each time they are shown.
* Might have a performance impact on large blogs with high activity.
 * Consider not to place widgets on front page.
* If you experience performance issues with widgets, create a support issue (preferably with suggestions to remedy this :) )


= Testing =
* Frontier post is mainly tested with:
* Wordpress 4.1
 * [Suffusion Theme](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/suffusion/)
 * and sometimes with twenty thirteen theme...
* iPad & iPhone: Safari & Chrome - Windows 7: IE9, Firefox & Chrome
